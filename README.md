# TaskForge

TaskForge is a lightweight, dependency-aware task runner written in Go. It helps developers define, manage, and execute project tasks in a clean, predictable way using a simple CLI.

> Think of it as a smarter alternative to ad-hoc shell scripts and Makefiles — packaged as a single Go binary.
